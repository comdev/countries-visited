    <li>If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, but you oppose the deletion of the data and instead request the restriction of the data processing.</li>
    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
