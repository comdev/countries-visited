            <p>Other data is automatically collected by our IT systems when you visit the website, either automatically or with your consent. These are mainly technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of page access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.</p>
            <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>
            <p>Some of the data is collected to ensure the proper provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>
            <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>
            <p>You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient, and purpose of your stored personal data free of charge at any time.

            <p>Detailed information about these analysis programs can be found in the following privacy policy.</p>
            <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
            <p>We host the content of our website with the following provider:</p>
            <h3>Strato</h3>
            <p>The provider is Strato AG, Otto-Ostrowski-Straße 7, 10249 Berlin (hereinafter referred to as "Strato"). When you visit our website, Strato collects various log files including your IP addresses.</p>

            <p>The use of Strato is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We have a legitimate interest in the most reliable possible presentation of our website. If consent was requested, the processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDDG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <h4>Data Processing Agreement</h4>
            <p>We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the aforementioned service. This is a data protectionally required contract that ensures that the personal data of our website visitors are processed only according to our instructions and in compliance with the DSGVO.</p>
            <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
            <h3>Data Protection</h3>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
            <p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
            <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by e-mail) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
            <h3>Information about the Responsible Party</h3>
            <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
            <p>Cornelius Müller<br />
                Roßdorfer Str. 3<br />
                60385 Frankfurt am Main</p>
                <p>Phone: +49 1622185582<br />
                Email: info@countries-visited.com</p>

            
            <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
            <p>Unless a more specific storage period is specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing ceases to exist. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur once these reasons cease to exist.</p>
            <h3>General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
            <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 Para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 Para. 1 GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing additionally occurs based on § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases for each individual case are provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
            <p>In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various external entities. It is sometimes necessary to transfer personal data to these external entities. We only disclose personal data to external entities if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR in the disclosure, or if another legal basis permits data disclosure. When using data processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
            <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
            <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING IS PROVIDED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</p>
            <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).</p>
            <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
            <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
            <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
            <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
            <p>Under the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, their origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing at any time, as well as a right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose and for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
            <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do so, you can contact us at any time. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
                duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
            <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
            <li>If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data may – apart from their storage – only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
            <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
            <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the website operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
            <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Our website uses so-called "cookies." Cookies are small packets of data that do not cause any damage to your device. They are either temporarily stored for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (persistent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit ends. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or until automatic deletion by your web browser occurs.</p>
            <p>Cookies can be set by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
                Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services provided by third-party companies within websites
                (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).</p>
            <p>Cookies have various functions. Numerous cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to analyze user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
            <p>Cookies that are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process, for the provision of certain functions desired by you (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or for the optimization of the website (e.g., cookies for measuring the web audience) are stored based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent for the storage of cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing will be carried out exclusively based on this consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
            <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.</p>
            <p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Cookie Consent Manager</h3>
            <p>Our website uses the Cookie Consent Manager service, allowing you to manage your privacy preferences and give consent for the use of cookies and other tracking technologies. By utilizing the Cookie Consent Manager, you have the option to adjust your privacy settings and control which types of cookies and tracking technologies you wish to allow.</p>

            <h3>Google Tag Manager</h3>
            <p>We utilize Google Tag Manager, a service provided by Google LLC, to simplify the management of website tags. Google Tag Manager is a tool that enables us to implement tags or code snippets on our website, including those provided by Google Analytics. Please note that Google Tag Manager itself does not collect any personal data. For more information on data processing by Google, please refer to their privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC. Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to help analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. For more information on data processing by Google, please refer to their privacy policy.</p>

            <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
            <p>Our website uses Google AdSense, a service provided by Google LLC, to display ads. Google AdSense uses cookies to show relevant advertisements to users based on their browsing history and preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>Data Collected:</strong> Google AdSense may collect data such as your IP address, browsing habits, and interactions with ads. This information is used to serve personalized ads that are relevant to your interests.</p>
            <p><strong>Ad Personalization:</strong> Google AdSense uses cookies and other technologies to deliver ads tailored to your preferences. You can control ad personalization through your Google account settings or by managing cookies via our Cookie Consent tool.</p>

            <h2>5. Plugins and Tools</h2>
            <h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>
            <p>We use the mapping service provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM).</p>
            <p>We integrate the map material from OpenStreetMap on the server of the OpenStreetMap Foundation, St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is considered a data protectionally secure third country. This means that the United Kingdom has a level of data protection equivalent to that in the European Union. When using OpenStreetMap maps, a connection is made to the servers of the OpenStreetMap Foundation. Your IP address and other information about your behavior on this website may be transmitted to the OSMF. OpenStreetMap may store cookies in your browser or use similar recognition technologies for this purpose.</p>
            <p>The use of OpenStreetMap is in the interest of an appealing presentation of our online offers and an easy findability of the locations specified by us on the website. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. If consent has been requested, processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 Para. 1 TTDSG, provided that the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) as defined by the TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
